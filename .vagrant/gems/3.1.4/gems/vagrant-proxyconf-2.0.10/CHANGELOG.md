# 2.0.10 / 2020-07-03

This is a bug fix release when provisioning docker hosts inside of
vagrant. This version removes the hard coded DOCKER_CONFIG environment
variable in /etc/environment and hard codes the client config to
/home/vagrant/.docker/config.json. This is a temporary work around until
the this can be refactored.

Existing values in /home/vagrant/.docker/config.json should be preserved
and merged when the vagrant-proxy conf is being provisioned.

#### Closed Issues

- [Respect Existing Docker Config Location #218](https://github.com/tmatilai/vagrant-proxyconf/issues/218)


# 2.0.9 / Not released

A release tagging error caused this release to become a draft release
and this will be re-released as 2.0.10.


# 2.0.8 / 2020-06-10

This is a bug fix release for windows users which fixes a bug with the
tempfile creation when uploading and downloading files from the vagrant
machine.

This is a feature enhancement for the APT proxy configuration when using
a proxy that is terminating SSL.  By default, these settings are left
as-is and only enabled when a user wants to configure these settings.
This feature supports enabling/disabling the follwoing settings

#### file `/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/01proxy`

```
Acquire::https::Verify-Host
Acquire::https::Verify-Peer
```

#### Configuration settings for `Acquire::https::Verify-Host` and `Acquire::https::Verify-Peer`

  * The value for these settings must be a string.
  * When `"true"` enable the setting
  * When `"false"` disable the setting
  * When `""` this setting is removed.

#### Example Inside the Vagrantfile

```
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|

  config.vm.define 'apt_host' do |c|
    c.vm.box = "bento/ubuntu-18.04"

    if Vagrant.has_plugin?('vagrant-proxyconf')
      c.proxy.http     = ENV['HTTP_PROXY']
      c.proxy.https    = ENV['HTTPS_PROXY']
      c.proxy.no_proxy = ENV['NO_PROXY']
      c.apt_proxy.verify_host = "false"
      c.apt_proxy.verify_peer = "false"

      c.proxy.enabled = {
        :apt => {
          :enabled => true,
          :skip    => false,
        },
        :env => {
          :enabled => true,
          :skip    => false,
        },
        :git => {
          :enabled => true,
          :skip    => false,
        }
      }
    end
  end

end
```

#### Example setting the environment variables

```
export VAGRANT_APT_VERIFY_HOST="false"
export VAGRANT_APT_VERIFY_PEER="false"
vagrant up
vagrant provision
```

**NOTE** If you change a setting in your `Vagrantfile` and the box is
running, you can run `vagrant provision` or `vagrant reload` to adjust
the settings.
